- cleanup empty functions

- finish language cleanup

- sane/secure defaults:
  - configure through config.h (for appropriate options)
  - referer
  - user agent
  - cookies

  - fix html margins:
    - no forced margin by default
    - configurable through config.h
  - better font support

- links and links-g?

- get rid of _BSD_SOURCE macro
  - completely if possible
  - _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE aren't as bad

- check if restrict is being used correctly
  - its likely not even necessary

- other error mechanisms should be replaced with die()

- fix command-line flag handling

- remove if (x) free(x), it only guards against free(NULL) which is a no-op

- name member in dnsentry and dnsquery structures was never a string yet it is
  being (mis)used as one. there are a number of places where this results in
  use of out of bounds memory. these NEED to be fixed, its amazing the code
  ever worked at all
  - not necessarily correct, however the code should be simplified to be
    more understandable.
